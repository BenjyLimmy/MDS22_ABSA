Dell said the AMAZON third party seller resold the computer on AMAZON months after it bought the computer, and the warranty began to run earlier when the third party seller bought the computer. Not when I purchased the computer on Amazon! This should not be HAPPENING. I contacted the Company and they said nothing was wrong!It came saying the last time it had been updated was August 18th and took the entire first day to get up to date.In regards to the Computer, it runs super fast. It has a battery that dies really quickly which is why I was checking the warranty. The Power in this computer dies so fast and the fans are always running. It the touch screen is nice and it seems to have a good quality. The Sound is pretty good after it is updated. It seems to have more durability than most computers but time will tell."

And extended warranty company Asurion.Amazon's  practice of listing and selling products like Dell computers for third party sellers seems like a scam, since the third party seller can sell old products on Amazon where the warranty is already expired or almost so.  And I saw nothing on AMAZON's site when I bought the DELL computer that things like an expired or limited time warranty could be an issue when buying ON AMAZON from a third party seller.Bought this Dell computer on Amazon, July 16, 2024, and Jan.3, 2025 the screen separated from the cover.  Contacted Dell, and they advised the WARRANTY was EXPIRED!  That's less than 6 months.  Dell said the AMAZON third party seller resold the computer on AMAZON months after it bought the computer, and the warranty began to run earlier when the third party seller bought the computer. Not when I purchased the computer on Amazon!Spent hours on the phone with Dell, and they know about this issue with third party sellers.  Even after providing them with the Amazon invoice and receipt of when I took possession of the computer, they would not help me and apply and run the warranty to the date I bought the computer from Amazon.Amazon's rep basically said sorry, but that's my problem for buying from a third party seller. Say what?  I bought the computer on AMAZON and paid AMAZON.  Now I'm out of luck?To make matters worse, I bought an extended warranty on Amazon from Asurion on the same day I bought the Dell computer on Amazon.  When I tried to make a claim, Asurion auto responded that the Dell computer still has the manufactures warranty and to contact Dell, seemingly as a result of only having purchased the computer from Amazon in July.  And not taking into account that the warranty started to run when the third party seller bought the computer months earlier.Shame on Dell, Amazon, and Asurion."

It was basically ready to use- just turned it on, answered a few questions and I was up and running.  No scratches or dings.  The only issue I see is that the magnet does not engage easily on closing- so you have to take care to close it gently a couple of times to have it engage.  This is not really a problem unless you run out of battery.  But you should always be aware of that, anyway.  Also-  received it in 1 day!  Even though it was scheduled to come in 3 days!  Very happy that I paid 1/4 of what I paid for my last laptop and so far I like it better!!!"

I first noticed it's poor battery life (<2 hours with light web browsing) and customer support was quick to mail me a new battery I could install. Before the battery arrived I noticed it also had a cracked frame. Again, customer service was prompt to send me a replacement laptop. When I had the same problem with battery life, even a little worse (90 minutes total), they told me they were sure it met their refurbished standards for a laptop in \"excellent\" condition before it left their warehouse. I promise it did not. It was also missing 5 different drivers when it arrived that I had to install through Dell Support. I have little faith in their quality checks. Now that I've installed those drivers, and received the replacement laptop that thankfully doesn't have a cracked frame, my main complaint is battery life. I think they owe me a replacement battery. 90 minutes is ridiculous. If you're reading this, please respond!"

The keyboard lights up. The cover is attractive. The unit works perfectly. Buy new--it's worth it."

It was usable but I could not close the cover.  The speed was also slow.  After doing some research, I found this Dell model.  The hp was bigger and that posed some problems.  This size is better.  The only drawback that I didn't notice when I ordered is that it does not have backlit keys.  Other dells have had this and once you have, it you get spoiled.  For now, it's been great."

                "review_text": "I purchased a Dell 3520 Win 11 Pro from a reseller \"Like New\". A few things folks might find helpful. 1. Dell sells a limited set of configurations (Memory, SSD, etc), so resellers open the laptop to \"upgrade\" memory, SSD to offer more choice in configurations. Of course, this begs the question what components are being installed. In my case the components were reasonable: 16GB Samsung DDR4 3200 memory and WD Green 1TB SSD, but its \"reasonable\" to check the delivered system. 2. Microsoft defaults to keeping a \"remarkable\" amount of information about your activities, like every app installed, every webpage viewed, etc., so I strongly suggest logging into your Microsoft account (account.microsoft.com) and turn on every privacy control they provide. Then clear the accumulated history and log into the account in a day or so and check if they stopped accumulating data. 3. Windows PRO provides S Mode which is a restrictive version of Windows (only M$ store apps, lighter weight process controls etc). This is mostly for PCs going to less than trusted employees. Turning off S Mode is a one-way trip, i.e. it cannot be reenabled (essentially forever). The system I receive had S Mode off. This is something I would have done anyway, but it's something to consider if you need S Mode for employee users."

                "review_text": "I can only begin this review with serious misgivings about this particular Dell Inspirion laptop.  When one purchases a product from a \"Dell Vendor\", one presumes it is a 100% Dell product.  Apparently this was not the case with this laptop.  Exactly 3 days after the Amazon/Vendor's return policy ran out, this laptop stopped working.  The error message was \"Corrupt Hard Drive\".  I can understand electronic devices will sometimes have issues.  I can also understand manufacturers and vendors need to have a limit on how long they will allow items to be returned.  So we called Dell Warranty Service, and they were very helpful.  They sent a box, pre-paid shipping label and we thought that would be the end of it.  Wait a reasonable time for the laptop to be repaired under warranty, and we could go on with our lives.  NOT SO.  According to the Dell Warranty Center, this particular laptop has a 3rd Party Hard Drive.  Not a hard-drive provided by Dell or installed by Dell or used by Dell.  So... our laptop was... in fact... not able to be repaired under warranty.  Dell has offered to fix the laptop and install the correct, but the repair is nearly as much as the laptop cost new from Amazon.  This is totally unacceptable!  When we bought the laptop, we presumed it was a new Dell Laptop with appropriately sourced and installed electronics that would be approved by Dell (or installed by Dell)... BUYER BEWARE of ROKC Electronics.  They have offered NO Help,  NO Sympathy,  and we are now completely out of the money we spent, and have a laptop that is absolutely Useless!!!!  I can only imagine if we were still in the window for return, they would put the same Non-Dell parts back in, and we would be facing similar issues down the road.  This is not the way to run a business.  And certainly not the way an Amazon vendor should be doing business.  Very Very Very Disappointed!"
