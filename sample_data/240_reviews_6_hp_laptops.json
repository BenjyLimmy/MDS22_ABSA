System was completely removed from laptop while doing class work, sent it to Hp and warranty was voided due to the seller modifying the laptop and adding 1TB when it’s only suppose to come with 256gb. Reached out to Amazon and they said I should receive call from seller which I never did. After seeing everyone else’s reviews I’m sure I won’t get anywhere with them and not willing to pay a $200 bs restocking fee! Hubby is a computer wiz luckily (I should’ve let him look at it first but wanted to use my warranty). These computers are refurbished, all the parts are from HP EXCEPT for the 1TB Hard drive, which is made from Kingston. Did some research and a 1TB drive is only $60 (I would purchase a different brand than Kingston since it’s the cheapest, you get what you pay for). YouTube how to open and replace the hard drive (easy af)  and do it yourself. But this company seems to make sure these laptops only last but a year which is terrible for people using their last to buy the price of crap , trying to get through school/work etc. Smh. BUYER BEWARE I brought the Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB hard drive from Amazon for $70 and paid an extra $12 for a 2 year warranty .. just installed it and re-installed Windows 11 and EVERYTHING was backed up once I signed back in to Microsoft which makes me extremely happy!! DO NOT send your laptop back to this company, they will only sell it again with a weak/used hard drive for $400 to someone else….It’s cheaper to fix it yourself. :)"

The constant need to lookup passwords may cause some to give up and return their computer in favor of something like an iPad. The computer is well built with a good keyboard. mouse pad,  and excellent touch screen,  but Microsoft's attempts to implement security and lock users into their proprietary MS applications and Onedrive cloud software makes what used to be an intuitive easy to use system almost useless for users with little to no experience with the use of Windows. As a 40-year Windows user and long-time programmer who's written millions of lines of code, even I find the intrusive security settings and constant need to enter multiple passwords a pain."

I spent hours searching for how to turn it off. To save you the time, here is the info: Turning off S Mode is permanent. Once you turn it off, you can't turn it back on. To turn off S Mode, go to Settings > System > Activation. Under \"Switch to Windows 11 Pro,\" click Go to the Store, then click \"Get.\" If you don't have a Microsoft Account, the only way to get rid of S mode is to disable Secure Boot in the UEFI (BIOS)."

                "review_text": "HP 14 Laptop (14-dq0040nr) – Affordable and Portable, but with Some Trade-offs ⭐ Rating: 4.0/5 ⭐ Pros: ✅ Affordable Price – This HP 14 laptop is budget-friendly, making it a great option for students, light users, or those in need of a secondary device. ✅ Portable & Lightweight – The thin and lightweight design makes it easy to carry around, ideal for on-the-go use. ✅ Decent Display – The 14-inch HD micro-edge display offers clear visuals, though it's not full HD. ✅ Windows 11 Home – Comes with the latest OS, which is optimized for modern applications. ✅ 1-Year Microsoft 365 Subscription – A great addition for users who rely on Word, Excel, and other Office tools. Cons: ❌ Limited Performance – The Intel Celeron N4020 processor is okay for basic tasks like web browsing, email, and document editing, but struggles with multitasking or demanding applications. ❌ Only 4GB RAM – The memory is quite low for modern standards, leading to slower performance when multiple tabs or applications are open. ❌ Minimal Storage (64GB eMMC) – The storage space is extremely limited, meaning you'll need external storage or cloud solutions for larger files. ❌ Not Ideal for Heavy Use – Not recommended for gaming, video editing, or other intensive tasks. ❌ No Backlit Keyboard – Typing in low-light conditions can be challenging. Final Verdict: The HP 14 Laptop (14-dq0040nr) is a solid choice for those needing an affordable, portable device for light tasks like browsing, streaming, and office work. However, its limited RAM and storage make it less suitable for power users or heavy multitaskers. If you need a simple laptop for everyday use and don't mind relying on cloud storage, this could be a good pick—but if you need better performance, consider upgrading to a model with more RAM and SSD storage."

S mode limits the software you can use to those available in the Microsoft store. It wouldn't let me use LastPass or Dropbox. It came with Dropbox for S mode, but I couldn't get it to run. I removed S mode - once it's gone it can't be restored - and Dropbox and LastPass ran fine as did Chrome. It took several hours for Dropbox to sync my files, but it did so effectively. Thus, I have access to everything on my hard drive at home. I plugged in a tiny Samsung 256 GB flash drive (it costs $22 on Amazon) into a USB port and now I have far more storage than I'll ever need on this computer. The drive is so small that I'll leave it there for the life of the computer. All the programs I'll need when away from home run on this device. I wouldn't try to use it for gaming, but as a work away-from-home laptop for relatively simple tasks, it does the job at a very affordable price."

                "review_text": "The HP 14 is a great choice for those looking for a basic laptop under $200, but it’s not for gamers, designers, or anyone who does more than the basics on their computer. Most surprisingly, it’s even decent  for streaming video and for cord cutters who can take advantage of the HDMI port to connect to a larger display. The basics:  It comes with Windows 11 Home in S mode, but you can easily switch out of S mode if you need to install additional programs not found on the Microsoft store. I turned it off with 4 minutes of use, so that’s a breeze.  And of course, this laptop features a 14-inch 1920 x 1080 display, an Intel Celeron N4020 processor, and 4GB of RAM. **Here are some of the highlights of the HP 14:** * **Great for basic tasks:** The HP 14 can handle basic tasks such as browsing the web, checking email, and using productivity software, but with only 4GB of RAM, I  experienced some  slowdowns when I had many tabs open in my browser or was running multiple programs at once. * **Long battery life:** The laptop can last up to 6.5 hours on a single charge. I was definitely impressed! * **Comfortable keyboard:** The keyboard is bouncy with a generous click and plenty of room for typing.if you like firmer keyboards, this one may not be your jam. * **SD card slot:** The HP 14 includes an SD card slot, which is a rarity for laptops in this price range.perfect for me,because my trail cam’s card can be emptied daily with ease! * **HDMI port:** as mentioned, this is great  for cord cutters who want to connect to a larger display or projector. My last cheap laptop was twice the price of this one and didn’t have an hdmi or a card reader. **Here are some things to keep in mind:** * **Small touchpad:** The touchpad is small and can be difficult to use. * **Dim screen:** The screen is a bit dim and I found it impossible to use outside no matter how I adjusted the display settings. * **Low storage:** 64GB of storage may not be enough for some users. * **Limited RAM:** 4GB of RAM  limits multitasking capabilities. I don’t know yet if those last two items are upgradable, but I’ll check into it if things get bogged down over the next few weeks! **Overall, the HP 14 is a great laptop for students, casual users, and anyone looking for a basic laptop under $200, especially if you don't plan on running multiple programs at once.  However, if you need a laptop for more demanding tasks, you may want to consider a model with more RAM.**"

Not a dealbreaker though. It’s a little slow but she gets the job done. If you want a computer to blow you away with how great it is, spend some more money and get a better one. BUT if you need a nice little laptop to get the essentials done, this will do the trick. But if you’re going to get all nitpicky then invest some more cash in a different computer."

                "review_text": "Good value. I purchased this model: (HP 255 G10 Laptop, Ryzen 3 7330U, 15.6\", 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD with Windows 11 Pro) from the seller Chromebook Prosale via Amazon for $399 in December of 2024. I had to return the first one because it had a RAM error. Every other time I started it, the Caps Lock LED would blink (3 long and two short). According to the documentation, that meant a RAM issue. Might have just needed a cleaning or the RAM was installed improperly. (more on that later.) I'll never know because I didn't want to void the warranty. So I sent it back and the seller promptly sent a new one. No errors on that one. YAY! Booted it up and it indeed had no errors, recognized all hardware, and had Windows 11 Pro installed. All good. Pretty quick. WiFi has typical range. There are two USB ports, one HDMI port, and one 1/8\" audio jack. Battery holds a charge like a champ. No security port. However, I'm pretty satisfied with this laptop. Being satisfied, I then voided the warranty and opened the system to take a look. (I don't recommend this for the casual user because, though I'm not sure, I think it will void your warranty - if they find out that is!) Now the interesting part: TLDR: Be careful when buying from third-party sellers. You might save money, but you never know where the laptop has been or whose grubby paws were inside it! See attached image of the RAM. Note that only one stick is covered with a sticker. This leads me to believe that HP built this laptop with 8 GB of RAM (1 stick) originally. I can't prove it, but I think that the seller (or another intermediary) installed the 2nd stick of RAM to bring it up to 16 GB. Three clues led me to this deduction (which is guesswork): 1 - the lack of a sticker. That's weak sauce, and HP QA would probably not let that pass before leaving the manufacturer. 2. One of the panel's front corners was slightly lifted off two of the clips, as if the person who closed the panel (after installing the RAM) didn't finish the job properly. Made it easier for me to pop the panel though! 3. The first laptop I received had that RAM issue I mentioned. That would probably not pass QA at an HP manufacturing plant either. Standard procedure is to have a system booted at least three times. Am I happy with my assumption? No. But I'll deal with it after inspecting the RAM installed and comparing it with the first 8 GB stick. The laptop looks clean and I inspected Windows 11 as well for any \"weirdness\" or inappropriate programs. That said, would I purchase this again or recommend it. Only if a person's sole criteria for buying was price. Generally, I recommend buying laptops from the manufacturer directly."

I tried to request a refund but it was 1 day past the 30 day window. I tried to file an asurian claim but was told since it was so new I had to deal with the manufacturers warranty. HP had to send a package to me to send it back so it took a few weeks before I finally got contacted by them. They informed me the laptop had been filled with cheap aftermarket parts voiding their warranty and recommended not buying off Amazon because of sketchy sellers like Chromebook Prosale. Had to wait for the computer to return and then contacted Amazon and explained the situation and they told me I had to go direct with the seller. They demanded I try a bunch of basic trouble shooting techniques despite HP already diagnosing it. Finally they agreed to a refund and issued a return tag to ship it. It arrived to them in 3 days but they refused to process a return for another 10 days claiming it was Amazon's policy and they have nothing to do with it. If you buy from them you are rolling the dice, because if it breaks I can assure you they will fight you every step of the way to get it returned or fixed."

I think the weakness of the material mixed with how big it is, makes it warp a smidge when held from one of the corners. Otherwise it has been great. I do wish I had paid attention when seeing reviews about the keyboard backlights. It is really hard to work in the dark due to the keys just going pitch black. I do really love it though!

My air pods constantly disconnect from it which is annoying, especially in a meeting. Also it disconnects from the internet at least 1-2x daily which is frustrating. It’s easy to set up which is great. Also, you don’t have to set up the Microsoft office/word/excell etc… It tries to make it seem like you have to, but why pay for it yearly when you can purchase it one time on Amazon, install, and never have to pay for it again? The speed is decent, not terrible, but also nothing to write home about which is expected for a computer at this basic level. I have had to deal with freezing once so far, but other than that it doesn’t seem to freeze up. The screen is just okay. Nothing is super clean on on video calls people look grainy and so do I. The trick is to sit in natural light which seems to give the best image. All in all this is decent, but if you have another $100-$200 to spend on something nicer I suggest doing so."

The system runs smoothly and the specs are great for a casual laptop, most of the ports run smoothly besides the headphone jack. The plastic feels cheap but it's lightweight as advertised. There's slim gaps between the keys that are apparently the perfect size for debris and dog hair, that's alright got a keyboard cover. Then the big issue has come along. It's not a month old and it's overheating constantly in the winter. A new laptop shouldn't be overheating at all. Nonetheless in the winter with its fans on a solid surface."

Probably should take it somewhere but why put hundreds of dollars in to this computer and it may wind up with more problems (all my stuff stolen) I had an old computer for about 8 years and only paid half of the price this one was but it was not a name brand. Just thought a name brand would be better. Was I wrong, for now on I buy the cheapest one they have. I mainly do word processing. I'll just get a cheap one then if it a pain in the ass I can pitch it and get another. I think they are all made in China on the same production line and put them in a different manufacturer case. It actually looks cheaper then my old $250 computer that I had the only problem was the plactic on it started to disintegrated and cracking and the screen was coming apart.  Cheap for me for now on when it comes to computers.  And yes I know $425 is not an expensive computer but my $225 was better."

Buying on black Friday made the purchase all them more sweet. I bought this specifically to support working from home and occasionally a laptop for hotel travel. Other reviews are only partially correct about external monitor support. Out of the box you can have only 1 external monitor (using the laptops only HDMI port). however if you buy a USB to HDMI hub such as amazon SKU B0D59XJ21H then laptop DOES support 3 external monitors + laptop for a total of 4 independent monitors. I have this configuration running as I type, it is working great. The speed of this machine is great. It multitasks very well. I like the backlit keyboard. As for what I do not like: *as a touch typist it is \"hard\" to find home because \"gh\" is not center line of laptop but offset a several inches left.  It is such a big un-natural shift  I ended up adding a 1/8\" strip of black tape under the space bar above the touch pad for my thumbs to have a tactile reference as well. * the USB-C port does not support laptop charging. For the price paid, the laptop should have this as it would have eliminated a cord entering the laptop.  It makes \"sense\" to me to have a USB hub  that everything connects to including power and then a single cord goes from hub into laptop thus minimizing the collection of cords tethering the laptop to the desk."

You cannot get these specs from HP (they only offer >16GB memory and 1TB SSD versions on my model). Therefore HP will alert that they have no record of the serial number and product number for the warranty. Why? Because that much memory and SSD isn't something they offer, ao it doesnt tally in their system. This is why the seller warranties the laptop for a year, because of the upgrades they've done. So please, know that you're getting an upgraded laptop from an 'upgrader' vs a standard (lower spec) one direct from HP. I reached out to the seller with questions in order to understand and learn this. But the laptop I received was exactly what they said it would be. It's just HP can't warranty it BECAUSE of the upgrades done by someone else (that HP doesn't offer). Laptop seems great though, with all the standard bloatware that HP puts on there I had to remove. I see some bad reviews because users were shown a malicious website, why? Has nothing to do with the laptop lol."

Same as most negative reviews on here, I wish I read them before buying. Looked used, had someone else’s email and folders. Got rid of the email but couldn’t get rid of folders or rename them, they were named someone else’s name. Did a factory reset now nothing works and I have to pay someone to fix it. Not recommended"

I made this HP Laptop purchase after extensive research and comparison. I have a Dell Inspiron and was very pleased with it's performance. However, the outdated 7200 rpm hard drive over heated too many times and finally crashed.  I was able to clone most of the data to a new SSD drive; and upgraded the RAM to 16 GBs and the Dell kept marching along. Now, I find the Dell to lag, slows down when using multiple programs, and freezes at the most inopportune times (I use it for djing). So, I decided to purchase a new computer during the holiday \"savings\" period.  Again, after a lot of research, reviewing, waiting, comparing, and hoping, I finally purchased this HP laptop. It boasted a \"high octane\" bundle of components that would make computing \"fast and furious\". I have not witnessed that yet.  I find the WIndows 11 platform to be non-user friendly, non-ergodynamic, and error ridden. The HP seems to constantly search for something before loading web browsers, programs, and commands. This is frustrating because the HP has the 12th gen i7 chip, 32 GB of RAM and a host of other high speed components that don't seem to be working in sync with each others.  Is this HP a great value?  The short answer is Yes! However, buyer beware that cheap prices often come with a cheap build with discount internal hardware components that take longer to work with each other causing frustration and anxiety. Next time, I think I will buy directly from manufacturer and ensure they use proprietary components that are compatible."

Called Amazon and was given a return label and instructions to return for refund. Laptop went back in a timely manner to the middle-man, PCOnline. After receiving the laptop they issued a full refund. The refund included the sales tax. It took longer than normal as the laptop had to go by ground due to the battery. PCOnline, Amazon and my internet provider were nothing but true professionals. They were great to work with. Would I buy this again? I most certainly would. I had nothing but great treatment from everyone I spoke with either by email or by phone or chat. The only negative was the shipping had to be via ground."

If I simply fold up the laptop and put it in my backpack the next time I go to use it, it will be dead. Guaranteed. The only way to prevent that seems to be powering it all the way down. I would say the battery is only good for about an hour or 2 of work before it needs to be plugged in. This is just being picky but the mouse pad feels a bit cheap definitely could be better quality and less clunky.

Sending it back. I will say that for the brief amount I was able to use the machine, it was nice. I would highly recommend getting a screen protector to knock down the glare. It's a shiny screen. The keyboard felt nice and I felt the screen looked nice. Touchscreen worked well and was very responsive. Overall, I won't give it a 1 star because when it ran, it ran well. It just failed on a Windows update so what do ya really do with that. I might try another similar model and revisit this review if I do."

My goal was to pay at least 1k this time for a quality laptop because I have never spent over $350 for one before. So it responds well, runs multiple tabs/ programs well without lag. But I guess something has to be sacrificed and that is battery life 🔋. My old laptop of 12 years holds a longer charge without the devices being plugged in so that is the reason I gave a 4 rating and not a 5. I wanted to give a 4.5 rating because the touchscreen is so convenient especially when sorting through emails to delete, surfing websites, playing solitaire 😂/gaming, etc... Overall, it did not exceed expectations but is great device."

                "review_text": "I thought this was just the right PC for us. We don't need much, web browsing, some gaming, some MS Office work. Yesterday I saw that the laptop OS needed update so started it. Noticed it was taking some time so I just let it do its thing all day. Went to turn the laptop back on that evening, and got a flash from the monitor but nothing else. I knew it wasn't a power issue because the separate mouse (not included) was lit, indicating it was connected. Tried everything I could think of then went to HP website. HP tells me there's 15 days left on the warranty (\"whew!\") and gave me repair options (phone, chat, local warranty provider [Best Buy]). I chose to go to Best Buy. They worked on the laptop for about 25 minutes, and while I can't tell exactly what was done, I do know it was a series of keystrokes and a flash drive. Geek Squad hands the laptop back to me and tells me it's a hardware issue and not worth the cost of repair. I take the laptop back home and get in a chat with technical support. They have me do what appears to be the same steps Geek Squad did. Then they tell me I need an empty flash drive to reset/reinstall the BIOS. Now I'm not really that tech savvy, but I know enough to tell the technician that all the steps that they have had me do I already had done by Geek Squad, their authorized repair center. Tech tells me that without doing that last step with the empty flash drive they cannot determine that it is truly a hardware issue (really??!) and that they won't be able to give me a repair/replacement if I don't take that last step. Sorry, HP, but you cannot convince me that the cost of a replacement laptop is worth more than the bad taste in my mouth, and my withering review (not only on Amazon, but to anyone who asks) of your inability to honor your very limited warranty. I can't imagine why you wouldn't send a replacement of a low-end laptop just to keep positive goodwill towards your customers. And it's why I strongly suggest anyone reading this review to search for a different unit."

With 8GB of RAM and the Intel Celeron N4120, it handles web browsing, streaming, and Office 365 apps smoothly. The HD display is clear and crisp, and the built-in webcam has been perfect for video calls with friends and family. She also loves how lightweight and portable it is—easy to carry around whether she’s working from home or on the go. Plus, having Windows 11 Home pre-installed and a 1-year Office 365 subscription was a nice bonus. Overall, this laptop has exceeded our expectations, and after two months of regular use, it’s still running like a charm. Definitely a great gift choice!"

It runs on all the up to date programs. It does sometimes turn off for no reason or be hard to turn on, so much so that I be thinking it's going to die and not come back on (but this I think is an HP issue not the seller).  It came with a free year of Microsoft Suite which is a huge selling point. However, I have learned a lot over the last week ab buying products like this on Amazon.  So if I have to buy another laptop from Amazon.  I would buy the Amazon renewed premium since it has a 1yr warranty and comes with a check list of what was tested, battery life, etc."

The screen appears dark, and I attempted to repair it, but I am not a technician. I suspect there was an issue with the screen, as only certain areas show this discoloration, and there are also some minor damages."

As someone who is always on the go, I needed a reliable laptop that could keep up with my busy schedule, and this laptop has exceeded all of my expectations. Let's start with the design - this laptop is sleek, lightweight, and portable, making it perfect for carrying around campus or taking to meetings. The 14\" screen is the perfect size for both work and play, and the Intel Quad-Core N4120 processor ensures that everything runs smoothly and quickly. The 8GB of RAM and 192GB of storage (64GB eMMC + 128GB Micro SD) provide more than enough space for all of my files, photos, and videos. One of my favorite features of this laptop is the 1 Year Office 365 subscription that comes included. Having access to all of the Microsoft Office programs has made it so much easier for me to stay organized and productive. The webcam is great for virtual meetings, and the HDMI, WiFi, and USB-A ports make it easy to connect to external devices and accessories. But what truly sets this laptop apart is its incredible value for the price. I was a bit hesitant at first because of how affordable it is, but I can confidently say that this laptop is worth every penny. The performance and quality are on par with laptops that cost twice as much, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. In conclusion, if you're a student or a business professional in need of a reliable, efficient, and affordable laptop, with amazing battery life, look no further than the HP Newest 14\" Ultralight Laptop. It's a 5-star product that will truly make your life easier and more enjoyable. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!."

UPDATE: I have had this for less than 3 months and the battery no longer holds a charge. It has to remain plugged in at all times, and finding information to replace the battery has been difficult. Not all the keys register being pressed, causing endless spelling and grammatical issues. As time goes on this problem gets worse. The shift key locks on at random times as do random F keys. The mouse pad keeps getting stick and will not register clicks or randomly registers extra clicks. Half the troubleshooting abilities are being removed, and locating various places has become a scavenger hunt. It consistently has memory problems, despite the fact I save nothing to the actual computer. So much so it has no memory to watch streaming shows, to open any folder or to save anything. During this review I have had to deal with every problem above. If you want a basic laptop that you don't mind correcting and leaving as a desktop, this is fine. Not recommended for writing, watching videos, web searching, emailing, anything in works. Very basic in what it can do and you will be constantly adjusting what you do, including rewriting everything you write and reloading the same page over and over. Highly disappointed in this. I needed a simple computer to write on, and this has been more frustrating than useful. Not worth the money and effort."

If you're lured to these by an Amazon flash offer, and begin to compare other options/offers, be sure to throughly compare the descriptions. Or you'll purchase something you didn't want. If you find this out after you set everything up and there is no problem with the computer itself, you're stuck with it. The other issue I had was the inability to exit Win 11 S mode. After hours of trying the standard method and several youtube videos with complex work arounds, I gave up. Today I decided to express my feelings in the MS Edge search window and I received this response from Copilot. (posted in the picture above). I post because subsequent requests produced different results. This work around worked quickly and was a three step fix. Have exited S mode and am happily running Google Chrome. Plus all my Google info and files from my broken laptop ported over. One last note: this is definitely a computer for students. It is priced reasonably considering post Covid greedflation prices. It is comparetively slow and not for use use for gamers. I will keep it as I need a computer for research and writing papers. 5/30/2024-My laptop broke. Needed to complete paperwork for a project with tight time lured by \"Deal\" for laptop with 4GB ram 64 storage Bluetooth, Wi-Fi. $169, 12hr delivery.  I figure it was good enough to get my work done. At the site several other options were available with the same features and more memory. All had delivery dates of 1=2 days except 1 with 8GB ram, 192GB storage for $259 w/ $40 coupon, Thought extra memory and storage was worth extra $90. Computer arrived. It took an 1-1/2 hr to do updates. When I tried to download Chrome to work in Google docs {state recommended for changes}. This computer is locked into MS S mode blocking download of apps not in MS store. After spending 2hrs trying  different S mode exit directions is was resolved to doing the work on my Samsung S20 which took 3 hours to do 1 hr of work. This computer doesn't have Bluetooth, is extremely slow. MS locks y into using Edge in a worse case scenario than they did with Explorer 25 yrs ago. Don't be lured by the free1yr of Home 365. Cannot return because I used it and is technically not broken. HP is obviously returning to the days of cheap low-grade Compaq. Clearest example of Greedflation. It also moved data from broken laptop creating what will be hours of scrubbing to sell at 1/2 price on Ebay."

Maybe it takes a $300 laptop so I don't have to deal with built in Alexa-enabled something, HP-specific ports, fingerprint scanner, and other stuff I don't want or need. They don't try anything fancy with this one which for me is a positive. Plus it's TKL keyboard which really should be the new norm. Does not have a backlit keyboard which is a slight miss but for the price it's not a huge deal. You can take it out of S-mode easily and remove a lot of the addons and you have yourself a perfectly functional Windows machine. Despite the lower-tier hardware it still starts up very quickly if you make sure you don't have too much bloatware. Sure it's a little slow at times but if you're using it for day to day tasks it should be fine. Battery life seems very good, the laptop is also fairly lightweight as well. What more could you ask for at this price point."

I cannot use this laptop until I receive the actual SD card that’s compatible and not sticking out to millimeters and not even being read by the HP.  so I technically have no extra storage because of all the updates and everything that are done prior to them sending the laptop I only have 22.5 GB available out of 57.3.

I don't really use the mouse tracking pad, but it hooks up to my USB mouse just fine! I think that this laptop would be perfect for someone who doesn't need to load a lot of programs, maybe someone who enjoys streaming videos, or just browsing the internet. Overall I think this is a good laptop for the price, but do your research to make sure this is what you are looking for.

I am figuring “what the heck” it made set up new PC easy. Big mistake!  You have to understand everything was automatic up this point.  I didn’t get real feel for the laptop. When I finally got around to actually using PC it was BAD.  It picked sometimes without hitting left button (the “hover” function was turned on --- I tried to turn off NOPE).  Often, I had to press the left button several times to pick.  Later on, when I hit left button it acted as if I pressed right button. (given a choice number of actions “open new window” etc.). I requested a return and Amazon approved my request.  But here’s the rub: Amazon does not want my personal files on the laptop.  But my new laptop is a clone of old desktop through the connection with THE CLOUD – anything I do to one of PC is reflected on other PC!  I thought I broke the connection by disabling the laptop access to router NOPE.  When I try to delete a file from laptop, the laptop says “cannot delete file because you are offline”.  Apparently, the new laptop is a good PC, I just happened get this lemon.  I will try to show you the problems on video. I could only upload one video -- I press the left button and PC act like I pressed the right button."

The features work as described, but the sturdiness of this laptop will surely be tested by my son. That said, it delivers functionality, value for money, and overall build quality that is impressive at this price. I recommend this laptop for students and business professionals."

My only issue is the track pad - needs a lot of pressure. No matter... I hooked up a wireless mouse an all is well But when HP makes a next generation, I'd def suggest fixing that."
