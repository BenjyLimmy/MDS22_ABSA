Warranty for 1 year.System was completely removed from laptop while doing class work, sent it to Hp and warranty was voided due to the seller modifying the laptop and adding 1TB when it\u2019s only suppose to come with 256gb. Reached out to Amazon and they said I should receive call from seller which I never did. After seeing everyone else\u2019s reviews I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t get anywhere with them and not willing to pay a $200 bs restocking fee! Hubby is a computer wiz luckily (I should\u2019ve let him look at it first but wanted to use my warranty).These computers are refurbished, all the parts are from HP EXCEPT for the 1TB Hard drive, which is made from Kingston. Did some research and a 1TB drive is only $60 (I would purchase a different brand than Kingston since it\u2019s the cheapest, you get what you pay for).YouTube how to open and replace the hard drive (easy af)  and do it yourself. But this company seems to make sure these laptops only last but a year which is terrible for people using their last to buy the price of crap , trying to get through school/work etc. Smh. BUYER BEWAREI brought the Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB hard drive from Amazon for $70 and paid an extra $12 for a 2 year warranty .. just installed it and re-installed Windows 11 and EVERYTHING was backed up once I signed back in to Microsoft which makes me extremely happy!! DO NOT send your laptop back to this company, they will only sell it again with a weak/used hard drive for $400 to someone else\u2026.It\u2019s cheaper to fix it yourself. :)"

S mode limits the software you can use to those available in the Microsoft store. It wouldn't let me use LastPass or Dropbox. It came with Dropbox for S mode, but I couldn't get it to run.I removed S mode - once it's gone it can't be restored - and Dropbox and LastPass ran fine as did Chrome. It took several hours for Dropbox to sync my files, but it did so effectively. Thus, I have access to everything on my hard drive at home. I plugged in a tiny Samsung 256 GB flash drive (it costs $22 on Amazon) into a USB port and now I have far more storage than I'll ever need on this computer. The drive is so small that I'll leave it there for the life of the computer.All the programs I'll need when away from home run on this device. I wouldn't try to use it for gaming, but as a work away-from-home laptop for relatively simple tasks, it does the job at a very affordable price."

However, its limited RAM and storage make it less suitable for power users or heavy multitaskers. If you need a simple laptop for everyday use and don't mind relying on cloud storage, this could be a good pick\u2014but if you need better performance, consider upgrading to a model with more RAM and SSD storage."

Most surprisingly, it\u2019s even decent  for streaming video and for cord cutters who can take advantage of the HDMI port to connect to a larger display.The basics:  It comes with Windows 11 Home in S mode, but you can easily switch out of S mode if you need to install additional programs not found on the Microsoft store. I turned it off with 4 minutes of use, so that\u2019s a breeze.  And of course, this laptop features a 14-inch 1920 x 1080 display, an Intel Celeron N4020 processor, and 4GB of RAM.**Here are some of the highlights of the HP 14:*** **Great for basic tasks:** The HP 14 can handle basic tasks such as browsing the web, checking email, and using productivity software, but with only 4GB of RAM, I  experienced some  slowdowns when I had many tabs open in my browser or was running multiple programs at once.* **Long battery life:** The laptop can last up to 6.5 hours on a single charge. I was definitely impressed!* **Comfortable keyboard:** The keyboard is bouncy with a generous click and plenty of room for typing.if you like firmer keyboards, this one may not be your jam.* **SD card slot:** The HP 14 includes an SD card slot, which is a rarity for laptops in this price range.perfect for me,because my trail cam\u2019s card can be emptied daily with ease!* **HDMI port:** as mentioned, this is great  for cord cutters who want to connect to a larger display or projector. My last cheap laptop was twice the price of this one and didn\u2019t have an hdmi or a card reader.**Here are some things to keep in mind:*** **Small touchpad:** The touchpad is small and can be difficult to use.* **Dim screen:** The screen is a bit dim and I found it impossible to use outside no matter how I adjusted the display settings.* **Low storage:** 64GB of storage may not be enough for some users.* **Limited RAM:** 4GB of RAM  limits multitasking capabilities.I don\u2019t know yet if those last two items are upgradable, but I\u2019ll check into it if things get bogged down over the next few weeks!**Overall, the HP 14 is a great laptop for students, casual users, and anyone looking for a basic laptop under $200, especially if you don't plan on running multiple programs at once.  However, if you need a laptop for more demanding tasks, you may want to consider a model with more RAM.**"

The thing felt incredibly flimsy, and the entire keyboard could be pushed in without much effort.  Awkward feeling keyboard feel and layout too.  The screen quality was awful.  If you weren't looking at the exact perfect angle, the screen would appear faded out and the color would change.  It has an extremely narrow range of viewing angles.  I could never adjust my eyes to the color, and photos would look simply terrible.  My Chromebook has vastly superior color rendering, and the screen looks good at a wide range of viewing angles.  The resolution was purported to be 1080, but the pixels seemed very large and most things appeared \"blocky\".  But the worst part of this computer was the performance.  Unbelievably slow!  Web pages would take forever to load, text would come in, and a bunch of white boxes would appear on screen until each image would load.  It is not my connection either, as I ran this computer right next to my Chromebook, which had none of these loading problems.  This computer was so slow that it would literally hang up while I was typing!  I would start to type a sentence, and nothing would happen on screen, then a few seconds later, the words would start to show up.  I closed everything but one web browser to compose an email, and I could not write simple text without the computer lagging behind.  It was beyond terrible to the point I may have just gotten a lemon.  But if this was not a broken machine, it's the worst computer I have ever used.  Returned it less than a week after using, I was fed up!"

Once you succeed,  it will take you straight to windows and you will find your free Microsoft there and all you have to do is click on word and accept license. (Also this process helps you get off windows s mood) That way you can enjoy your Laptop.Also, if you email is already tied to a 365 account it will be wise to use a neutral email as this may interfer with you getting the decline offer button.

                "review_text": "Just what I was looking for: a light-weight HP laptop that has Microsoft lifetime non-subscription,  upgraded features. I've been satisfactorily using Windows 10 on two 17-inch laptops (an HP and a Lenovo) for several years. But when Microsoft announced not supporting WIN 10 and encouraging the installation of WIN 11, I knew I would have to \"bite the bullet\" and upgrade before I ended up having to buy Windows 11. WIN 11 comes pre-installed. I've become accustomed to using Office suites since the mid-90s (okay, okay I'm now 78).  Free pre-installation of the latest of the non-subscription Office suites (2024) was a big plus when considering the purchase of this new laptop.  I hope I'm all set for the rest of my life.  I was also looking for a laptop that--as I age--I could much more easily carry around the house than I can right now carry my 17-inchers.  (It could also be easier to carry when I pack up other personals if ever notified to evacuate due to fire, wind, or earthquake.) Also, realizing that I didn't necessarily need a 17-inch laptop any longer, I chose a less expensive 15-incher. By the way, validating the pre-installed Office 2019 is easy. Just don't hurry, read everything on the screen as you work toward validation, and you'll be done with that step in four minutes! Watch that you do not install Microsoft 365 'cause you'll have to pay for and subscribe to it. If you don't need it, then Office is truly adequate for you. The legal pre-installed version of Office 2019 is genuine Microsoft software that does not come with a product key and, therefore, it does not need to be registered with Microsoft.  (If you have an online Microsoft account, it's up to you if you want to register the laptop itself.)  One more thing, once you're done with setup process, you'll notice that OneDrive is the default for synchronizing. If you're not familiar with OneDrive, go online to understand what it's for and how it works. Contact the seller via Amazon's communication feature for anything. Just click his name on the right side of the product description page and you'll arrive at the seller's profile with the link for communication in the upper right corner."

And extended warranty company Asurion.Amazon's  practice of listing and selling products like Dell computers for third party sellers seems like a scam, since the third party seller can sell old products on Amazon where the warranty is already expired or almost so.  And I saw nothing on AMAZON's site when I bought the DELL computer that things like an expired or limited time warranty could be an issue when buying ON AMAZON from a third party seller.Bought this Dell computer on Amazon, July 16, 2024, and Jan.3, 2025 the screen separated from the cover.  Contacted Dell, and they advised the WARRANTY was EXPIRED!  That's less than 6 months.  Dell said the AMAZON third party seller resold the computer on AMAZON months after it bought the computer, and the warranty began to run earlier when the third party seller bought the computer. Not when I purchased the computer on Amazon!Spent hours on the phone with Dell, and they know about this issue with third party sellers.  Even after providing them with the Amazon invoice and receipt of when I took possession of the computer, they would not help me and apply and run the warranty to the date I bought the computer from Amazon.Amazon's rep basically said sorry, but that's my problem for buying from a third party seller. Say what?  I bought the computer on AMAZON and paid AMAZON.  Now I'm out of luck?To make matters worse, I bought an extended warranty on Amazon from Asurion on the same day I bought the Dell computer on Amazon.  When I tried to make a claim, Asurion auto responded that the Dell computer still has the manufactures warranty and to contact Dell, seemingly as a result of only having purchased the computer from Amazon in July.  And not taking into account that the warranty started to run when the third party seller bought the computer months earlier.Shame on Dell, Amazon, and Asurion."

But we all know about MS issues.  No problems getting my critical Windows 10 software installed.  I gave up on getting the MS tools (like Outlook, Excel, Word) re-installed, because of all the license junk they add on to make it impossible (let's just call it \"Bill's revenge,\" ok?

We got blue screen and kernel security problem and it froze and had to reboot it hard and turned on and upon doing something a blue screen popped up again experiencing problem again. Talk to agent and nobody could help. Will return if not fixed in a month\u2019s time.Update: So much it caused us just to return this item. Beware of the return label especially if it\u2019s outside USA as you have to pay for your shipment because the waybill number would be invalid. We have returned it after 2 months. Also make sure ask the seller to provide you with MSDS form as it is needed to process your return. I don\u2019t recommend buying from 3rd party seller or marketplace seller like Tech Plus Pro as Dell won\u2019t recognize your laptop for warranty even if it\u2019s brand new. We\u2019ll see if they will refund me fully and even the shipping fee and import fees. I will update soon.Update: They are refusing to refund me.

Dell sells a limited set of configurations (Memory, SSD, etc), so resellers open the laptop to \"upgrade\" memory, SSD to offer more choice in configurations. Of course, this begs the question what components are being installed. In my case the components were reasonable: 16GB Samsung DDR4 3200 memory and WD Green 1TB SSD, but its \"reasonable\" to check the delivered system. 2. Microsoft defaults to keeping a \"remarkable\" amount of information about your activities, like every app installed, every webpage viewed, etc., so I strongly suggest logging into your Microsoft account (account.microsoft.com) and turn on every privacy control they provide. Then clear the accumulated history and log into the account in a day or so and check if they stopped accumulating data. 3. Windows PRO provides S Mode which is a restrictive version of Windows (only M$ store apps, lighter weight process controls etc). This is mostly for PCs going to less than trusted employees. Turning off S Mode is a one-way trip, i.e. it cannot be reenabled (essentially forever). The system I receive had S Mode off. This is something I would have done anyway, but it's something to consider if you need S Mode for employee users."

                "review_text": "I can only begin this review with serious misgivings about this particular Dell Inspirion laptop.  When one purchases a product from a \"Dell Vendor\", one presumes it is a 100% Dell product.  Apparently this was not the case with this laptop.  Exactly 3 days after the Amazon/Vendor's return policy ran out, this laptop stopped working.  The error message was \"Corrupt Hard Drive\".  I can understand electronic devices will sometimes have issues.  I can also understand manufacturers and vendors need to have a limit on how long they will allow items to be returned.  So we called Dell Warranty Service, and they were very helpful.  They sent a box, pre-paid shipping label and we thought that would be the end of it.  Wait a reasonable time for the laptop to be repaired under warranty, and we could go on with our lives.  NOT SO.  According to the Dell Warranty Center, this particular laptop has a 3rd Party Hard Drive.  Not a hard-drive provided by Dell or installed by Dell or used by Dell.  So... our laptop was... in fact... not able to be repaired under warranty.  Dell has offered to fix the laptop and install the correct, but the repair is nearly as much as the laptop cost new from Amazon.  This is totally unacceptable!  When we bought the laptop, we presumed it was a new Dell Laptop with appropriately sourced and installed electronics that would be approved by Dell (or installed by Dell)... BUYER BEWARE of ROKC Electronics.  They have offered NO Help,  NO Sympathy,  and we are now completely out of the money we spent, and have a laptop that is absolutely Useless!!!!  I can only imagine if we were still in the window for return, they would put the same Non-Dell parts back in, and we would be facing similar issues down the road.  This is not the way to run a business.  And certainly not the way an Amazon vendor should be doing business.  Very Very Very Disappointed!"

Warranty for 1 year.System was completely removed from laptop while doing class work, sent it to Hp and warranty was voided due to the seller modifying the laptop and adding 1TB when it\u2019s only suppose to come with 256gb. Reached out to Amazon and they said I should receive call from seller which I never did. After seeing everyone else\u2019s reviews I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t get anywhere with them and not willing to pay a $200 bs restocking fee! Hubby is a computer wiz luckily (I should\u2019ve let him look at it first but wanted to use my warranty).These computers are refurbished, all the parts are from HP EXCEPT for the 1TB Hard drive, which is made from Kingston. Did some research and a 1TB drive is only $60 (I would purchase a different brand than Kingston since it\u2019s the cheapest, you get what you pay for).YouTube how to open and replace the hard drive (easy af)  and do it yourself. But this company seems to make sure these laptops only last but a year which is terrible for people using their last to buy the price of crap , trying to get through school/work etc. Smh. BUYER BEWAREI brought the Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB hard drive from Amazon for $70 and paid an extra $12 for a 2 year warranty .. just installed it and re-installed Windows 11 and EVERYTHING was backed up once I signed back in to Microsoft which makes me extremely happy!! DO NOT send your laptop back to this company, they will only sell it again with a weak/used hard drive for $400 to someone else\u2026.It\u2019s cheaper to fix it yourself. :)"

S mode limits the software you can use to those available in the Microsoft store. It wouldn't let me use LastPass or Dropbox. It came with Dropbox for S mode, but I couldn't get it to run.I removed S mode - once it's gone it can't be restored - and Dropbox and LastPass ran fine as did Chrome. It took several hours for Dropbox to sync my files, but it did so effectively. Thus, I have access to everything on my hard drive at home. I plugged in a tiny Samsung 256 GB flash drive (it costs $22 on Amazon) into a USB port and now I have far more storage than I'll ever need on this computer. The drive is so small that I'll leave it there for the life of the computer.All the programs I'll need when away from home run on this device. I wouldn't try to use it for gaming, but as a work away-from-home laptop for relatively simple tasks, it does the job at a very affordable price."

However, its limited RAM and storage make it less suitable for power users or heavy multitaskers. If you need a simple laptop for everyday use and don't mind relying on cloud storage, this could be a good pick\u2014but if you need better performance, consider upgrading to a model with more RAM and SSD storage."

Most surprisingly, it\u2019s even decent  for streaming video and for cord cutters who can take advantage of the HDMI port to connect to a larger display.The basics:  It comes with Windows 11 Home in S mode, but you can easily switch out of S mode if you need to install additional programs not found on the Microsoft store. I turned it off with 4 minutes of use, so that\u2019s a breeze.  And of course, this laptop features a 14-inch 1920 x 1080 display, an Intel Celeron N4020 processor, and 4GB of RAM.**Here are some of the highlights of the HP 14:*** **Great for basic tasks:** The HP 14 can handle basic tasks such as browsing the web, checking email, and using productivity software, but with only 4GB of RAM, I  experienced some  slowdowns when I had many tabs open in my browser or was running multiple programs at once.* **Long battery life:** The laptop can last up to 6.5 hours on a single charge. I was definitely impressed!* **Comfortable keyboard:** The keyboard is bouncy with a generous click and plenty of room for typing.if you like firmer keyboards, this one may not be your jam.* **SD card slot:** The HP 14 includes an SD card slot, which is a rarity for laptops in this price range.perfect for me,because my trail cam\u2019s card can be emptied daily with ease!* **HDMI port:** as mentioned, this is great  for cord cutters who want to connect to a larger display or projector. My last cheap laptop was twice the price of this one and didn\u2019t have an hdmi or a card reader.**Here are some things to keep in mind:*** **Small touchpad:** The touchpad is small and can be difficult to use.* **Dim screen:** The screen is a bit dim and I found it impossible to use outside no matter how I adjusted the display settings.* **Low storage:** 64GB of storage may not be enough for some users.* **Limited RAM:** 4GB of RAM  limits multitasking capabilities.I don\u2019t know yet if those last two items are upgradable, but I\u2019ll check into it if things get bogged down over the next few weeks!**Overall, the HP 14 is a great laptop for students, casual users, and anyone looking for a basic laptop under $200, especially if you don't plan on running multiple programs at once.  However, if you need a laptop for more demanding tasks, you may want to consider a model with more RAM.**"

The thing felt incredibly flimsy, and the entire keyboard could be pushed in without much effort.  Awkward feeling keyboard feel and layout too.  The screen quality was awful.  If you weren't looking at the exact perfect angle, the screen would appear faded out and the color would change.  It has an extremely narrow range of viewing angles.  I could never adjust my eyes to the color, and photos would look simply terrible.  My Chromebook has vastly superior color rendering, and the screen looks good at a wide range of viewing angles.  The resolution was purported to be 1080, but the pixels seemed very large and most things appeared \"blocky\".  But the worst part of this computer was the performance.  Unbelievably slow!  Web pages would take forever to load, text would come in, and a bunch of white boxes would appear on screen until each image would load.  It is not my connection either, as I ran this computer right next to my Chromebook, which had none of these loading problems.  This computer was so slow that it would literally hang up while I was typing!  I would start to type a sentence, and nothing would happen on screen, then a few seconds later, the words would start to show up.  I closed everything but one web browser to compose an email, and I could not write simple text without the computer lagging behind.  It was beyond terrible to the point I may have just gotten a lemon.  But if this was not a broken machine, it's the worst computer I have ever used.  Returned it less than a week after using, I was fed up!"

Once you succeed,  it will take you straight to windows and you will find your free Microsoft there and all you have to do is click on word and accept license.

I've been satisfactorily using Windows 10 on two 17-inch laptops (an HP and a Lenovo) for several years. But when Microsoft announced not supporting WIN 10 and encouraging the installation of WIN 11, I knew I would have to \"bite the bullet\" and upgrade before I ended up having to buy Windows 11. WIN 11 comes pre-installed. I've become accustomed to using Office suites since the mid-90s (okay, okay I'm now 78).  Free pre-installation of the latest of the non-subscription Office suites (2024) was a big plus when considering the purchase of this new laptop.  I hope I'm all set for the rest of my life.  I was also looking for a laptop that--as I age--I could much more easily carry around the house than I can right now carry my 17-inchers.  (It could also be easier to carry when I pack up other personals if ever notified to evacuate due to fire, wind, or earthquake.) Also, realizing that I didn't necessarily need a 17-inch laptop any longer, I chose a less expensive 15-incher. By the way, validating the pre-installed Office 2019 is easy. Just don't hurry, read everything on the screen as you work toward validation, and you'll be done with that step in four minutes! Watch that you do not install Microsoft 365 'cause you'll have to pay for and subscribe to it. If you don't need it, then Office is truly adequate for you. The legal pre-installed version of Office 2019 is genuine Microsoft software that does not come with a product key and, therefore, it does not need to be registered with Microsoft.  (If you have an online Microsoft account, it's up to you if you want to register the laptop itself.)  One more thing, once you're done with setup process, you'll notice that OneDrive is the default for synchronizing. If you're not familiar with OneDrive, go online to understand what it's for and how it works. Contact the seller via Amazon's communication feature for anything. Just click his name on the right side of the product description page and you'll arrive at the seller's profile with the link for communication in the upper right corner."

And extended warranty company Asurion.Amazon's  practice of listing and selling products like Dell computers for third party sellers seems like a scam, since the third party seller can sell old products on Amazon where the warranty is already expired or almost so.  And I saw nothing on AMAZON's site when I bought the DELL computer that things like an expired or limited time warranty could be an issue when buying ON AMAZON from a third party seller.Bought this Dell computer on Amazon, July 16, 2024, and Jan.3, 2025 the screen separated from the cover.  Contacted Dell, and they advised the WARRANTY was EXPIRED!  That's less than 6 months.  Dell said the AMAZON third party seller resold the computer on AMAZON months after it bought the computer, and the warranty began to run earlier when the third party seller bought the computer. Not when I purchased the computer on Amazon!Spent hours on the phone with Dell, and they know about this issue with third party sellers.  Even after providing them with the Amazon invoice and receipt of when I took possession of the computer, they would not help me and apply and run the warranty to the date I bought the computer from Amazon.Amazon's rep basically said sorry, but that's my problem for buying from a third party seller. Say what?  I bought the computer on AMAZON and paid AMAZON.  Now I'm out of luck?To make matters worse, I bought an extended warranty on Amazon from Asurion on the same day I bought the Dell computer on Amazon.  When I tried to make a claim, Asurion auto responded that the Dell computer still has the manufactures warranty and to contact Dell, seemingly as a result of only having purchased the computer from Amazon in July.  And not taking into account that the warranty started to run when the third party seller bought the computer months earlier.Shame on Dell, Amazon, and Asurion."

But we all know about MS issues.  No problems getting my critical Windows 10 software installed.  I gave up on getting the MS tools (like Outlook, Excel, Word) re-installed, because of all the license junk they add on to make it impossible (let's just call it \"Bill's revenge,\" ok?

We got blue screen and kernel security problem and it froze and had to reboot it hard and turned on and upon doing something a blue screen popped up again experiencing problem again. Talk to agent and nobody could help. Will return if not fixed in a month\u2019s time.Update: So much it caused us just to return this item. Beware of the return label especially if it\u2019s outside USA as you have to pay for your shipment because the waybill number would be invalid. We have returned it after 2 months. Also make sure ask the seller to provide you with MSDS form as it is needed to process your return. I don\u2019t recommend buying from 3rd party seller or marketplace seller like Tech Plus Pro as Dell won\u2019t recognize your laptop for warranty even if it\u2019s brand new. We\u2019ll see if they will refund me fully and even the shipping fee and import fees. I will update soon.Update: They are refusing to refund me.

The only drawback that I didn't notice when I ordered is that it does not have backlit keys.  Other dells have had this and once you have, it you get spoiled.  For now, it's been great."

                "review_text": "I purchased a Dell 3520 Win 11 Pro from a reseller \"Like New\". A few things folks might find helpful. 1. Dell sells a limited set of configurations (Memory, SSD, etc), so resellers open the laptop to \"upgrade\" memory, SSD to offer more choice in configurations. Of course, this begs the question what components are being installed. In my case the components were reasonable: 16GB Samsung DDR4 3200 memory and WD Green 1TB SSD, but its \"reasonable\" to check the delivered system. 2. Microsoft defaults to keeping a \"remarkable\" amount of information about your activities, like every app installed, every webpage viewed, etc., so I strongly suggest logging into your Microsoft account (account.microsoft.com) and turn on every privacy control they provide. Then clear the accumulated history and log into the account in a day or so and check if they stopped accumulating data. 3. Windows PRO provides S Mode which is a restrictive version of Windows (only M$ store apps, lighter weight process controls etc). This is mostly for PCs going to less than trusted employees. Turning off S Mode is a one-way trip, i.e. it cannot be reenabled (essentially forever). The system I receive had S Mode off. This is something I would have done anyway, but it's something to consider if you need S Mode for employee users."

                "review_text": "I can only begin this review with serious misgivings about this particular Dell Inspirion laptop.  When one purchases a product from a \"Dell Vendor\", one presumes it is a 100% Dell product.  Apparently this was not the case with this laptop.  Exactly 3 days after the Amazon/Vendor's return policy ran out, this laptop stopped working.  The error message was \"Corrupt Hard Drive\".  I can understand electronic devices will sometimes have issues.  I can also understand manufacturers and vendors need to have a limit on how long they will allow items to be returned.  So we called Dell Warranty Service, and they were very helpful.  They sent a box, pre-paid shipping label and we thought that would be the end of it.  Wait a reasonable time for the laptop to be repaired under warranty, and we could go on with our lives.  NOT SO.  According to the Dell Warranty Center, this particular laptop has a 3rd Party Hard Drive.  Not a hard-drive provided by Dell or installed by Dell or used by Dell.  So... our laptop was... in fact... not able to be repaired under warranty.  Dell has offered to fix the laptop and install the correct, but the repair is nearly as much as the laptop cost new from Amazon.  This is totally unacceptable!  When we bought the laptop, we presumed it was a new Dell Laptop with appropriately sourced and installed electronics that would be approved by Dell (or installed by Dell)... BUYER BEWARE of ROKC Electronics.  They have offered NO Help,  NO Sympathy,  and we are now completely out of the money we spent, and have a laptop that is absolutely Useless!!!!  I can only imagine if we were still in the window for return, they would put the same Non-Dell parts back in, and we would be facing similar issues down the road.  This is not the way to run a business.  And certainly not the way an Amazon vendor should be doing business.  Very Very Very Disappointed!"
