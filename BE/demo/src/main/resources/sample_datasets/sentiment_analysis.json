                "review_text": "Windows S Mode and McAfee are glitchy performance killers and restrictive applications.  Switching out of Win 11 S mode should be a straight forward process but it just does not work as it should, along with McAfee installed, whether you want it or not.  McAfee acts like a worm virus, intrusively imbedding itself deep into system architecture instead of being a gate keeper like other anti-virus apps.  Windows S Mode dose not allow you to install and run any app that is not Microsoft verified and found on the Microsoft Store.  In S Mode, you cannot install and run any browser other than MS Edge or Bing.  There is an app within the MS Store to switch out of S mode but it will not work because, I suspect, of the bloated software that launches when you first turn on and set up this laptop.  Switching out of S Mode is permanent.  All the advise and direction I found to get this switch to work had failed.  Lots of frustrated people out there with the same issue.  I finally got MS Support on the phone and they told me this is a very common problem with this product and the only way to resolve it was to reset the PC.  A total reset, wiping the OS and all files you may have added.  No big deal as this is a new PC and I did not transfer anything from my old PC.  After the PC was reset, I was able to switch out of S mode so that I now have Win 11 Home instead of Win 11S Home.  At the same time, a McAfee install popup was automatically prompted so I could select Do Not Install.  This was all a bit of a pain but other than that, this laptop is not so bad.  The display colors are not as vibrant as I hoped but with a resolution of only 1365 x 768, I should have expected that.  However, the graphics display very well on a connected higher resolution monitor and it handles steaming video from Amazon Prime Video beautifully.  I hope this information can help someone avoid the frustration of dealing with what was intentionally sold as a very restrictive operating environment.  Getting rid of S Mode and McAfee gives you back unrestricted use of your laptop.One more annoying detail is that, by default, this operating environment is set to save everything to the MS cloud. The default storage of Document, Downloads, Pictures, etcetera, are all MS cloud folders which is where every file is stored unless you go through a few more clicks to store the files on your local laptop drive.  By default, initially you cannot even boot up this laptop without entering your MS PIN to log onto your laptop, and thereby logging into your MS account at the same time.  I found this a bit presumptuous that MS thought this was a good idea.  Perhaps good for their own marketing efforts though, as some bot scans your files for things you do in order to tailor marketing ad pushes to you personally, but I digress.  If you do not want Big Brother holding on to all your personal, professional, private, or other data, then you need to go in to system settings and turn off the MS log in PIN.  Doing so allows you to boot up your laptop to your local drive account only.  You can always log in and log out of your MS account if and when you choose at any time.  Of course, you can even turn off your own laptop log in password so it just simply turns on. without a password.  Your choice, as it should be."

I\u2019ve tried hard resetting and am leaving it to charge overnight.

It offers excellent value for the price, especially with 16GB of RAM and 288GB of storage. However, if you need more power for intensive tasks, you may want to consider a more powerful machine. It\u2019s a great choice for students or anyone looking for a low-cost, everyday laptop."

                "review_text": "Windows S Mode and McAfee are glitchy performance killers and restrictive applications.  Switching out of Win 11 S mode should be a straight forward process but it just does not work as it should, along with McAfee installed, whether you want it or not.  McAfee acts like a worm virus, intrusively imbedding itself deep into system architecture instead of being a gate keeper like other anti-virus apps.  Windows S Mode dose not allow you to install and run any app that is not Microsoft verified and found on the Microsoft Store.  In S Mode, you cannot install and run any browser other than MS Edge or Bing.  There is an app within the MS Store to switch out of S mode but it will not work because, I suspect, of the bloated software that launches when you first turn on and set up this laptop.  Switching out of S Mode is permanent.  All the advise and direction I found to get this switch to work had failed.  Lots of frustrated people out there with the same issue.  I finally got MS Support on the phone and they told me this is a very common problem with this product and the only way to resolve it was to reset the PC.  A total reset, wiping the OS and all files you may have added.  No big deal as this is a new PC and I did not transfer anything from my old PC.  After the PC was reset, I was able to switch out of S mode so that I now have Win 11 Home instead of Win 11S Home.  At the same time, a McAfee install popup was automatically prompted so I could select Do Not Install.  This was all a bit of a pain but other than that, this laptop is not so bad.  The display colors are not as vibrant as I hoped but with a resolution of only 1365 x 768, I should have expected that.  However, the graphics display very well on a connected higher resolution monitor and it handles steaming video from Amazon Prime Video beautifully.  I hope this information can help someone avoid the frustration of dealing with what was intentionally sold as a very restrictive operating environment.  Getting rid of S Mode and McAfee gives you back unrestricted use of your laptop.One more annoying detail is that, by default, this operating environment is set to save everything to the MS cloud. The default storage of Document, Downloads, Pictures, etcetera, are all MS cloud folders which is where every file is stored unless you go through a few more clicks to store the files on your local laptop drive.  By default, initially you cannot even boot up this laptop without entering your MS PIN to log onto your laptop, and thereby logging into your MS account at the same time.  I found this a bit presumptuous that MS thought this was a good idea.  Perhaps good for their own marketing efforts though, as some bot scans your files for things you do in order to tailor marketing ad pushes to you personally, but I digress.  If you do not want Big Brother holding on to all your personal, professional, private, or other data, then you need to go in to system settings and turn off the MS log in PIN.  Doing so allows you to boot up your laptop to your local drive account only.  You can always log in and log out of your MS account if and when you choose at any time.  Of course, you can even turn off your own laptop log in password so it just simply turns on. without a password.  Your choice, as it should be."

Cost me a lot of time and  labor to figure this out\u2026\u2026.reason for 4 star vs 5.  Computer is fine but toss that drive in the trash."

Turns out after uninstalling Microsoft Copilot EVERYTHING sped up amazingly! I'll keep at 3 stars after using for a few days to confirm, but that seems to have been the trick to make this machine with its somewhat limited resources work much, much better. Stay tuned, folks."

After downloading those two, I set up 2 administrator users and one standard user. In the process of setting up the other administrator user: the laptop crashed and the screen turned black. I\u2019ve tried hard resetting and am leaving it to charge overnight. My intended use was for education for when I\u2019m not at home (I have a desktop and obviously no one is going to bring a whole tower to every class they go to) so I wasn\u2019t planning to use anything fancy \u2014 word and chrome.In terms of performance before it crashed:1) CPU was at 100% and was still slow when opening up apps (I wasn\u2019t far from my main mesh router and my actual desktop works fine so can\u2019t be internet problem)2) It made me do a recovery startup when I first unpackaged and logged into my microsoft acccount and the startup took about 20 minutes3) Breeze it up \u2014 it felt warm on the bottom after an hourThinking about returning it if the laptop still doesn\u2019t turn on (I\u2019ve tried 2 different outlets in 2 different rooms \u2014 [wall plug] and [my extender that has anker charger and an air purifier plugged in]) tmr afternoon).Edit: I\u2019m returning it and getting a refund; had it plugged in for a couple of days now and have been attempting to turn it on daily \u2014 no success; laptop still does not turn on"
