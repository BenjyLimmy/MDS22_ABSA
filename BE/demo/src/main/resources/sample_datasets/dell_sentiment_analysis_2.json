Not only can I use it for several high-powered apps, but I can easily remote into my desktop without much lag. I am indifferent about the touch screen, but I haven't truly utilized it yet. Sound quality is okay, but I prefer to use my Bluetooth headphones, which have absolutely no problem connecting. Battery life is typical, I get a couple hours when using my high powered apps, but significantly longer if I'm just using basic functions. Honestly, I highly recommend this laptop."

And I saw nothing on AMAZON's site when I bought the DELL computer that things like an expired or limited time warranty could be an issue when buying ON AMAZON from a third party seller.Bought this Dell computer on Amazon, February 24, 2025, delivered just a couple days ago and today on March 4, 2025 I checked the WARRANTY which only had less than 6 months LEFT. Dell said the AMAZON third party seller resold the computer on AMAZON months after it bought the computer, and the warranty began to run earlier when the third party seller bought the computer. Not when I purchased the computer on Amazon! This should not be HAPPENING. I contacted the Company and they said nothing was wrong!It came saying the last time it had been updated was August 18th and took the entire first day to get up to date.In regards to the Computer, it runs super fast. It has a battery that dies really quickly which is why I was checking the warranty. The Power in this computer dies so fast and the fans are always running. It the touch screen is nice and it seems to have a good quality. The Sound is pretty good after it is updated. It seems to have more durability than most computers but time will tell."

And extended warranty company Asurion.Amazon's  practice of listing and selling products like Dell computers for third party sellers seems like a scam, since the third party seller can sell old products on Amazon where the warranty is already expired or almost so.  And I saw nothing on AMAZON's site when I bought the DELL computer that things like an expired or limited time warranty could be an issue when buying ON AMAZON from a third party seller.Bought this Dell computer on Amazon, July 16, 2024, and Jan.3, 2025 the screen separated from the cover.  Contacted Dell, and they advised the WARRANTY was EXPIRED!  That's less than 6 months.  Dell said the AMAZON third party seller resold the computer on AMAZON months after it bought the computer, and the warranty began to run earlier when the third party seller bought the computer. Not when I purchased the computer on Amazon!Spent hours on the phone with Dell, and they know about this issue with third party sellers.  Even after providing them with the Amazon invoice and receipt of when I took possession of the computer, they would not help me and apply and run the warranty to the date I bought the computer from Amazon.Amazon's rep basically said sorry, but that's my problem for buying from a third party seller. Say what?  I bought the computer on AMAZON and paid AMAZON.  Now I'm out of luck?To make matters worse, I bought an extended warranty on Amazon from Asurion on the same day I bought the Dell computer on Amazon.  When I tried to make a claim, Asurion auto responded that the Dell computer still has the manufactures warranty and to contact Dell, seemingly as a result of only having purchased the computer from Amazon in July.  And not taking into account that the warranty started to run when the third party seller bought the computer months earlier.Shame on Dell, Amazon, and Asurion."

Love the keyboard which is nice and tight and includes a dedicated number pad to the right side. The core i3 processor is decent and doesn't get overloaded until you really push it which is expected at this price pt.Sometimes it may approach its memory limit but gives decent service - for just 8GB of RAM it works well and the sound quality isn't amazing but adequate. I consider it great value for money. I recommend it but probably with 16GB RAM and at least 500GB of SSD Storage.While in Miami to the end of March this year, we visited 3 retailers of tech products and were amazed at the oversell of sub-standard electronics. When we found this after spending 1/2 day searching at major retailers, we grabbed it! Delivery took under two days and we were impressed with the performance of the laptop and we were able to avoid the over-sell and condescending attitude of poorly trained tech experts who seemed to know much less than me about their own products."

Other than that, it also has a pretty slow loading time, I have high speed boosters to my internet so not that bad. Overall I like it, it does the job, otherwise I would've returned it"

Dell sells a limited set of configurations (Memory, SSD, etc), so resellers open the laptop to \"upgrade\" memory, SSD to offer more choice in configurations. Of course, this begs the question what components are being installed. In my case the components were reasonable: 16GB Samsung DDR4 3200 memory and WD Green 1TB SSD, but its \"reasonable\" to check the delivered system. 2. Microsoft defaults to keeping a \"remarkable\" amount of information about your activities, like every app installed, every webpage viewed, etc., so I strongly suggest logging into your Microsoft account (account.microsoft.com) and turn on every privacy control they provide. Then clear the accumulated history and log into the account in a day or so and check if they stopped accumulating data. 3. Windows PRO provides S Mode which is a restrictive version of Windows (only M$ store apps, lighter weight process controls etc). This is mostly for PCs going to less than trusted employees. Turning off S Mode is a one-way trip, i.e. it cannot be reenabled (essentially forever). The system I receive had S Mode off. This is something I would have done anyway, but it's something to consider if you need S Mode for employee users."

				"review_text": "I can only begin this review with serious misgivings about this particular Dell Inspirion laptop.  When one purchases a product from a \"Dell Vendor\", one presumes it is a 100% Dell product.  Apparently this was not the case with this laptop.  Exactly 3 days after the Amazon/Vendor's return policy ran out, this laptop stopped working.  The error message was \"Corrupt Hard Drive\".  I can understand electronic devices will sometimes have issues.  I can also understand manufacturers and vendors need to have a limit on how long they will allow items to be returned.  So we called Dell Warranty Service, and they were very helpful.  They sent a box, pre-paid shipping label and we thought that would be the end of it.  Wait a reasonable time for the laptop to be repaired under warranty, and we could go on with our lives.  NOT SO.  According to the Dell Warranty Center, this particular laptop has a 3rd Party Hard Drive.  Not a hard-drive provided by Dell or installed by Dell or used by Dell.  So... our laptop was... in fact... not able to be repaired under warranty.  Dell has offered to fix the laptop and install the correct, but the repair is nearly as much as the laptop cost new from Amazon.  This is totally unacceptable!  When we bought the laptop, we presumed it was a new Dell Laptop with appropriately sourced and installed electronics that would be approved by Dell (or installed by Dell)... BUYER BEWARE of ROKC Electronics.  They have offered NO Help,  NO Sympathy,  and we are now completely out of the money we spent, and have a laptop that is absolutely Useless!!!!  I can only imagine if we were still in the window for return, they would put the same Non-Dell parts back in, and we would be facing similar issues down the road.  This is not the way to run a business.  And certainly not the way an Amazon vendor should be doing business.  Very Very Very Disappointed!"

Including Word, Excel, OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint, Publisher, Access. Office 2021 is pre-installed and activated, Key is not needed and provided. Please DO NOT install Office 365, which invalidates the Office 2021 license.\" A day after our order, we received an email stating \"there was a problem fulfilling our order. They didn't load Office our our laptop and sent a code from a third party vendor. Via email, I stated I was returning the laptop and expected full refund. In the return instructions, it stated there could be a restocking fee although we never opened the box as well as a fee for shipping both ways. I attempted email confirmation that I would not be charged any fees without response. Reluctantly, we kept the computer and attempted to load the Office Suite via the code they sent. It was cumbersome and we did not want to remove the laptop from safely mode. They should have sent a Microsoft key not a third party vendor. They did refund $39.00 because we had to load it ourselves. This was not was advertised. In the end, we purchased the suite directly from Microsoft. If we knew Office would not have been loaded, we would not have chosen this seller. They didn't respond to emails until I demanded a response, and there is no telephone support. It has been very frustrating, but educational. Always look into who Amazon has fulfilling their orders. Next time, we'll order directly from Dell."

But we all know about MS issues.  No problems getting my critical Windows 10 software installed.  I gave up on getting the MS tools (like Outlook, Excel, Word) re-installed, because of all the license junk they add on to make it impossible (let's just call it \"Bill's revenge,\" ok?  Instead, I used Thunderbird for email (wow!!!!), and Google for the docs.  Way less of a pain.Crisp and clear screen -- really amazing.  Great SSD storage size, and very light.  Haven't tried to use unplugged for an afternoon, but I'm supposing it'll function.  Keyboard is kind of ok; fine for travelling, but not sure about using 24x7.
