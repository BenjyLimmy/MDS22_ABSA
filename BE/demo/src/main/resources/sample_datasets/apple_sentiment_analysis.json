I charged the computer to full and timed how long it would take the battery to go to 0. it took less than 4 hours. I notified the seller who used the excuse that the low battery life is due to it being a refurbished model. This was a very poor excuse and a lie. No where in the description does it say that the battery life would be less because its a refurb. On the contrary, its says the battery life should be an average of 10 hours and says nothing else. Refurb means that it should be like new with the possible exception of cosmetic. So what the seller is saying is a lie."

However, to my delight, the thing looked brand new. Felt brand new. I still can't tell the difference.  A few weeks in, and I love this thing so much. It's light and cute, and works wonderfully.

This product was described by the seller as \"Renewed - Excellent\" but was in Poor condition.The laptop had three very visible scratches on the outside cover, with additional scratches on the Apple logo. Worse yet, the backlit keyboard had MAJOR defects as 4 keys (A, S, E and D) had the letters completely worn off (and were illuminated as unreadable white blobs). Worse yet, a sticker had been haphazardly placed over the top of the D key. Not only was the sticker not even centered on the key, but a sticker on a key of a backlit keyboard disables the backlight functionality for that key.  Horrible. I have owned a lot of computers over the years and have never experienced keys wearing off on a keyboard. This thing was either abused or defective from the start. I have two laptops that I use to run my business. Both bought refurbished or used (without being refurbished) and both have been great for multiple years and still have no physical defects despite a lot of travel and heavy use.Overall, VERY disappointing and deserves a 1-star review, only because I cannot give it a zero.I received a return authorization and will be sending it back for a refund. This disappointing experience also resulted in my daughter not having a computer for her first day of high school orientation.  I\u2019m buying another one from a different seller today, so at least she will have it for the first day of class next week.There should be some sort of quality control process for allowing sellers to market renewed products under the Amazon name. Maybe there is and this one just slipped through the cracks.Update as of 9/10/24, I have still not received my refund or any communication from Amazon or the seller."

I trusted this company to give me a laptop that was atleast functional. For the first part it was, just a little slow. After a few times of me using it, The macbook would over heat, and not cool off properly. When I looked into the edges, I could see the inside WAS NOT cleaned properly, and I was correct when I happened to open the back of it up. It became very slow, and to the point of nothing working and I couldn\u2019t even do a software update to fix the slow issue.I purchased this on September 11, 2023. I am not in college yet, so I have not used it much. Probably barely even 10 times. I had the macbook in a bookbag with a box of crayola markers everytime I was not using it, and when I was using it, I NEVER set anything on the macbook, and dropped it. I have no idea how the lines ended up on my screen. I went to use the macbook after a charged it overnight, and leaving it on a table and I discovered the black lines. I was left clueless.I cleaned the inside of the macbook with q-tips, and both ends on all of them are completely black. I am SO disappointed. I advise anyone who buys this product, PLEASE check all of the functions of it as soon as you get it, and even open the inside of it if you can. I expected better from amazon."

Had to call their customer service to get a replacement ordered and this time delivered to my house. Amazon definitely provided great customer service on the replacement as well as the product itself. No scratches anywhere. It wasn\u2019t charged when I got it so make sure you already have a type c charger as I did. So far I really like this MacAir as it\u2019s my first Mac computer I\u2019ve ever bought. It\u2019s easy to navigate software wise and very lightweight(as expected). Speed is good on it as it\u2019s only 2 years old. Very good buy for the price."

The delivery was a couple of days early and I had to scramble to get someone to sign for it since I was at work and missed the first delivery attempt. Overall think it was a good purchase. Cheaper than new and a well functioning machine. It was well cared for before I bought it, or it seems to have been."

After some troubleshooting I was able to get the unit working but within a week it stopped again.

Also, came with the wrong power supply."
